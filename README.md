# EtaZero

This is my dissertation project for my final year studying as an undergraduate.

EtaZero is an AI built to play the game sevn (variation of the game [paletto](https://spielstein.com/games/paletto/rules)).
EtaZero will use a similar algorithm to AlphaZero, but will use a different neural network architecture: relational graph NN.

Included in this repository is:
* An implementation of the game, including visuals
* Some basic agents to play the game
* AlphaZero algorithm
* Relational graph neural netowrk
* Trainer to create data via self-play and train on it
* Arena to compare and rate the performance of agents
* iOS screen parsing to get the state of a game on the iOS app Sevn
* Data: model checkpoints, training data
